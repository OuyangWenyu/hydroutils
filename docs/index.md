**A collection of commonly used utility functions for hydrological modeling and analysis**

`hydroutils` is a comprehensive Python package that provides essential tools and utilities for hydrological data processing, statistical analysis, and modeling. It is designed to streamline common tasks in hydrology research and engineering applications.

## Key Features

### üìä Statistical Analysis
- Comprehensive hydrological statistics (NSE, KGE, RMSE, Bias, etc.)
- Flow duration curve analysis
- Peak flow analysis and timing metrics
- Flood event extraction and characterization

### üïê Time Period Processing
- Time period operations (intersection, generation, validation)
- Date string parsing and manipulation

### üìà Data Visualization
- Specialized plotting functions for hydrological data
- Flow duration curves
- Time series plots with hydrological context

### üìÅ File Operations
- CSV and text file processing
- Data import/export utilities

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Integration
- AWS S3 integration for large dataset handling
- Cloud-based data storage and retrieval

## Quick Start

```python
import hydroutils as hu

# Calculate hydrological statistics
nse = hu.stat_error(observed, simulated)['NSE']

# Extract flood events
events = hu.extract_flood_events(dataframe)

# Convert streamflow units
converted = hu.streamflow_unit_conv(data, basin_area, source_unit='cms', target_unit='mm/3h')
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install hydroutils
```
