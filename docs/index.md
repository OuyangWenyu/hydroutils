- Mathematical utilities for water resources calculations
- Array operations optimized for hydrological data

## Quick Start

```python
import hydroutils as hu

# Calculate hydrological statistics
nse = hu.stat_error(observed, simulated)['NSE']

# Extract flood events
events = hu.extract_flood_events(dataframe)

# Convert streamflow units
converted = hu.streamflow_unit_conv(data, from_unit='cms', to_unit='cfs')
```
